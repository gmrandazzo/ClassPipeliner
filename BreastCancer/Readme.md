# Results

To reproduce the results please execute the script run.x.

DNN (neural network) requires a lot of energy compared to the other ML methods.
A simpler method, such as the Partial Least Squares Discriminant analysis (PLS-DA)
perform similarly and require 200 less energy to develop an ML prediction model.

On average, a DNN requires 0.02 Watt; PLS-DA requires 0.0001 Watt.
